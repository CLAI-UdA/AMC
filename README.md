# Modeling Software Design Choices with Argumentation

This is an ongoing project whose aim is to model software design choices with argumentation frameworks. It is supported by the PNRR project FAIR â€“- Future AI Research (PE00000013), Spoke 9 -- Green-aware AI, under the NRRP MUR program funded by the NextGenerationEU. 

Files with extension `.af` are argumentation frameworks. For some of them, the files with same name and extension `.txt` show the correspoing results.
